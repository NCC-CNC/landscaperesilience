# Landscape Resilience Webtool

<b> Landscape Resilience</b> is an area of land marked with the combination of biodiversity and diverse, connected habitat that enables species to persist and adapt to environmental pressures over time.


Landscape Resilience Webtool is designed to support landscape scale conservation planning with aims to:
- identify unprotected resilient ares as candidates for area-based conservation
- identify degraded areas as candidates for restoration
- set priorities at the Canada-wide scale and provide a case for conservation

###
Areas with high Landscape Resilience implies biodiversity, connectivity, climate and habitat are well met with minimized threats.
